It only works for you in this plugin because you are using the new feature: plugin can provie its own name. But conceptually it should also work, if you wouldn\u0027t do that and copy your jar plugin from foo.jar to bar.jar and all works as expected. To achieve that, as minimum you should pass here the plugin name and not use the constant. Even better would be to find a way to do in on the fraework side.",
