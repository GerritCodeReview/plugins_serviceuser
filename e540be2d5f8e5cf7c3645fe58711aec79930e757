      "message": "Hi Thomas,\n\nI believe[1] broke the access to `page` so I navigate the page manually for now.\n\nI need your help to setup the correct capability check as you requested, I am not an expert in Gerrit and it seems like the manual capability filter is not trivial. I suggest to do this in different patch as it affect all the capability checks, currently this patch is in sync with the other classes.\n\nThanks,\nAlon\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/342835",
