      "message": "With this and with other similar places, I don\u0027t think that every user with createServiceuser capability should be able to change those parameters if it is not allowed. In our case for example every registered user is allowed to create serviceusers, since it is a self service. But we don\u0027t allow to set the email. There are however cases where a user requires an email and we as the admins will set it for them.\nMy suggestion would be to create a new capability administrateServiceusers that has admin rights for serviceusers, while craeteServiceuser remains as is. WDYT?",
