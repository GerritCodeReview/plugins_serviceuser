Is there any way to crank up the logging in the zuul test runner, or a way to make my local builds more like the zuul builds?\n\nLooking at my change I didn\u0027t change any annotations, which means that it must have been the change to the WORKSPACE. Darn dependencies. Do you have any tips on bisecting this?",
