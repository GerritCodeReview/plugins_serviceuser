      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is correct: service users are not actually part of the realm, so their field may be modified even if this is not possible for realm-users.\n\nAt least in our case: we use LDAP for auth, but serviceusers are *not* present in LDAP directory. These users exist only in Gerrit, not in LDAP, and it is therefore quite appropriate to change their name and email.",

      "message": "You are right. That is a valid scenario.\nWe could just add an additional configuration option for the service user plugin that allows to change the full name. To make it not too confusing, we could leave the defaults as it is, meaning as the realm that is used is configured. WDYT?",

      "message": "Indeed, it seems that this change was premature. To fix this, it can be just reverted.\n\nHowever, I did not create this change without reason. I faced the issue that, when I tried to change the full name, which isn\u0027t allowed in the realm we use, I got an error from Gerrit. Back then I thought this was the way it was designed and that I had just missed checking that in the UI. So I changed the UI accordingly. Thus, it might be that we have to fix another bug a well, if it is reproducible again after the revert.",
