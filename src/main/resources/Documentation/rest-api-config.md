The public SSH key for creating the service user must be specified in
the request body as a [ServiceUserInput](#service-user-input) entity.

Caller must be a member of a group that is granted the 'Create Service
User' capability (provided by this plugin) or the 'Administrate Server'
capability.

#### Request
