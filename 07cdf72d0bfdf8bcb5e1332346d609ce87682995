Why it souldn\u0027t land in the shaded plugin JAR? Because it\u0027s already included in gerrit core.\n\nThat\u0027s why it was included in provided_deps in Buck build:\n\n  provided_deps \u003d [\n    \u0027//lib/commons:codec\u0027,\n  ],\n\nIf unsure, just check if that artifact is included in plugin (it should not):\n\n  $ unzip -t bazel-genfiles/plugins/serviceuser/serviceuser.jar | grep org/apache/commons/codec | wc -l\n  35\n\nWhat you want is this:\n\n  $ unzip -t bazel-genfiles/plugins/serviceuser/serviceuser.jar | grep org/apache/commons/codec | wc -l\n  0\n\nBTW. commons-codec is used for Base64 encoding. This can be done now in native Java.",
